Section 1: Detailed Descriptions of Input Data files:

This data contains details about the experiments which have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket 
of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)
wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear 
acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data 
manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating 
the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding
windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion 
components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed
to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of 
features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following files and variables:
=========================================
- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features. : variable in program "features"

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set. : Variable in program "x.train"

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels. : Variable in program "y.train" 

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set. : Variable in program "x.test"

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.: Variable in program "y.test"

- Variable "combined" - contains the merged data of train &  test

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. 
    Its range is from 1 to 30. : Variable in program "subj.train"

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis 
    in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' 
    and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the 
    total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. 
    The units are radians/second. 

Notes: 
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
- The units used for the accelerations (total and body) are 'g's (gravity of earth -> 9.80665 m/seg2).
- The gyroscope units are rad/seg.
- A video of the experiment including an example of the
  6 recorded activities with one of the participants can be seen in the following link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOEN9W05_4A
  
 
 Section 2: Detailed Description of Transformation done of Input data:
 
 1) All input data files are downloaded and unzipped into data tables , as follows:
 
 - 'features.txt': List of all features. : variable in program "features" with dimensions: 561 obs of 2 variables

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set. : Variable in program "x.train"  with dimensions: 7352 obs of 561 variables

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels. : Variable in program "y.train"  with dimensions: 7352 obs of 561 variables

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set. : Variable in program "x.test"  with dimensions: 2947 obs of 1 variable

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.: Variable in program "y.test"  with dimensions: 2947 obs of 1 variable

2) Train data is appended with test data. Following is data tables:
- "dataSubj" - data table with subjects in train and test data. Dimensions : 10299 obs of 1 Variable
- "data.activity" - data table with activities from y.train and y.test data. Dimesions : 10299 obs of 1 variable
- "data.feat" - data table with x.train and x.test data . Dimensions : 10299 obs of 561 variables
3) Corresponding Column names are assigned ; refer code.
4) "combined" - data table column binds subjects with activities : Dimension 10299 obs of 2 variables
5) "Fulldata" data table column binds "data.feat" with subjects and activities ; Dimension: 10299 obs of  563 variables
6)  Column headings containing "mean()" or "std()" are selected using grep and stored in "subset.Feature.Names"
7) "selected.Names" is a list containing column with mean() or std() and corresponding subject and activity
8) "Extracted.data" is a data table subsetted from"Fulldata" with "selected.Names" as creteria; Dimensions 10299 obs of 68 variables
9) Acitivity description is given to the activities factors in the data table "Extracted.data"
10) Abbreviated strings are converted into Expanded form and stored in "Extracted.data"
11) "Average.value.data" is a data table which is aggregated from "Extracted.data" for each subject and activity with average(ie Mean) value 
12) "tidy.data" is data table which is ordered based on Subject and Activity
13) "tidy.data" is written into text file "Tidy.txt"

Section 3:
"Tidy.txt" Contains the required cleaned data.

Dimesions :  180 obs of 68 variables;

180 obs are unique observation based on each subject and its activities.
